Welcome to my website â€”a space where I share highlights from my work as well as reflect on the journey shaped by my daily efforts. As an ongoing project, this site serves both as a repository for my professional contributions and as a canvas for my evolving thoughts on how we interact with the spaces around us.

The design of our buildings and cities are, more often than not, based on hopes rather than post-occupancy studies.
