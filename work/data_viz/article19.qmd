### What is Article 19?
Article 19 is a non-profit organisation working to protect and promote the freedom of speech in the world. Based in London but with presence in all continents, their mission is 

> ... 'by working on two interlocking freedoms: the Freedom to Speak, and the Freedom to Know.
When either of these freedoms come under threat, ARTICLE 19 speaks with one voice.'

### My contributions
Initially, I was only commissioned to analyse a small series of data points. Quickly, we realized the potential to re'think their whole pipele for their annual GxR report.

This is still the main focus of my work, yet, the outputs expand beyond what's available online and now reach:

- **Public -general audience**
    - through visualisation embeds in [website](https://www.globalexpressionreport.org/).
    - hosted in 
- **Internal - A19 staff**
    - through data dashboards hosted in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/article19/vizzes).

### The Pipeline
The main objectives of creating a data pipeline where:

- to increase processing time to speed up publishing
- reduce production costs
- establish a low maintenance deployment
