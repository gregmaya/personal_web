    "text": "As a spatial data consultant, I mostly work with teams who want to take their data to the next level.\nMy approach is not to provide isolated solutions, but instead to walk the journey with you while making sure that the output is fit for purpose but also maintainable by you.\nMost of what I focus on:\n\nUrban diagnostics\nMorphological metrics for scenario testing\nPost-occupancy studies\nNetwork modeling for spatial and social environments\nSpatial visibility analysis\nInteractive data visualization (spatial and not!)\n\n\nTools & Softwares\nI use an array of tools depending on the needs. Yes, my preferance is usually to go open-source but this is not always possible. The following are just some tools I commonly use:\nPython, PostGIS - SQL, Tableau, QGIS, Isovists, Gephi, to name a few…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProp Tech\n Property technology companies are constantly trying to leverage their location information for augmented business insights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate Managers\n Managers need to create information pipelines to track and report space utilization for improving performance and community building. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitect Studios and Urban Planners\n Planners need analytics on land use, pedestrian movement, urban morphology, and more to create sustainable designs and policies based on evidence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademia\n Network theories, morphological analysis or data analysis are not common practices for most social sciencies nowadays, but current market asks for profesionals aware of these domains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualisation\n Most people and organisations need easy ways to represent and understand their data. I can help to create data pipelines and dashboards for revealing important information."
