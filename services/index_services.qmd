As a **spatial data consultant**, I mostly work with teams who want to take their data to the next level.

My approach is **not to provide isolated solutions**, but instead to walk the journey with you while making sure that the output is fit for purpose but also maintainable by you.

Most of what I focus on:

- Urban diagnostics
- Morphological metrics for scenario testing
- Post-occupancy studies
- Network modeling for spatial and social environments
- Spatial visibility analysis
- Interactive data visualization (spatial and not!)

### Tools & Softwares

I use an array of tools depending on the needs. Yes, my preferance is usually to go open-source but this is not always possible. The following are just some tools I commonly use: 

**Python**, **PostGIS - SQL**, [**Tableau**](https://www.credly.com/badges/d368cdea-2e12-4bee-900e-0c9dd3d58469), **QGIS**, [**Isovists**](https://isovists.org/), **Gephi**, to name a few...

Network theories, morphological analysis or data analysis are not common practices for most social sciencies nowadays, but current market asks for profesionals aware of these domains.
