## Bio

I am Gregorio Maya, **City Science Coordinator** at the [Norman Foster Institute](https://normanfosterinstitute.org/) and a freelance consultant for various NGOs. Trained as an architect with a _Summa Cum Laude_ degree, I have pivoted from traditional design to focus on the **data-driven aspects of urban environments**. My passion lies in analyzing spatial configurations to understand behavioral dynamics within built spaces, often applying principles of behavioral economics to enhance both client engagements and design outcomes.

In my role, I co-lecture in Urban Analytics and lead the technical development of sustainability tools for cities. As a Tableau-certified analyst proficient in open-source tools like Python, QGIS, and PostgreSQL, I contribute to creating sustainable urban solutions. My work involves mentoring the next generation of urban analysts, leading digital projects that **integrate data science with urban design**, and consulting for NGOs, providing insights that promote sustainable and effective urban development.

I maintain active academic ties not only with my _alma maters_, [The Bartlett-UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/bartlett-school-architecture) (UK) and [Universidad de los Andes](https://arqdis.uniandes.edu.co/) (COL), but also by collaborating closely with professors at [UCA Canterbury](https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/subject/architecture/) (UK) and [Universidad Nacional del Litoral](https://www.unl.edu.ar/) (ARG).
